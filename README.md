This is a repository of code written by me for a former employer. The company no longer exists and the code was never put into production.

It is a demo of a potential wellbeing app, written in Vue.js on the front end, and with a Django REST api on the back end.

I coded it all starting from scratch with no prior knowledge of Python and only a small understanding of JS, so it may well look a bit of a mess (there was no training). However, it was fun to do, and is here to show that I did it!

Any design work was handled by my collegue, and things like features and structure agreed upon in conversation with my team, although the solution was often what I thought I could make work! The choice of a Django/Vue stack was down to me because I thought Vue looked cool (it is).

None of the content is 'real', it's all placeholder stuff and stock images.

We decided to use Auth0 for third-party authorisation because none of us wanted to deal with personal information, so there is none in the repo.
